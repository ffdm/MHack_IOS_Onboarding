# Michigan Hackers IOS Team Onboarding
Welcome to the team! Whether you are new to coding in general or you're already a swift GOD you'll have the opportunity to learn a lot. We'll be coding in swift (Apple's programming language) this semester in the XCode IDE. We find that the best way of learning is by doing so we set up this onboarding project to help you familiarize yourself with Xcode, Swift, and app development in general so that we can get to some more complicated projects in the future.

The one prerequisite that's required for you to start working is that __you must be running some version of the MacOS operating system__. If you have a Mac, you're all set and should start downloading Xcode from the App Store. We highly recommend using a Mac; however, if this is not an option, there are some hacky ways to set up a Mac virtual machine on your Windows machine but we'll leave that up to you.


## WHAT THE HECK are we making?

We're going to make a number guesser for our first project! 

Yes. I know. It looks disgusting. But after you program all the functionallity of the app you'll get the opportunity to make it look however you like. It's your app after all.
