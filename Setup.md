# Xcode and Project Setup

## 1. Download Xcode

## 2. Clone our git repository
The next step is to get the starter code on your computer. We'll use git to do this. If you don't know what git/version control is that's okay, we can go in depth later in the semester. But for now just follow along. \

First things first click the green button on the top right of this page and copy the https github link for this project. \

Next you're going to want to open up Xcode and click "clone an existing project".

Paste the link you just copied into the text field at the top of the window and click __Clone__. This will prompt you for where you want to save the project on your computer. I recommend making some folder where you'll put all of your apps if you don't already have one. Once that is done cloning, go back to Xcode and you should see the project in the right hand view. Double click it and you'll open your project!
